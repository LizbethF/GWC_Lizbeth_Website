    I have big aspirations for my future career and hope to work in STEM inspiring young girls to pursue careers in STEM.
    I have practice coding in Scratch and Python, but  am excited to learn many new languages.

    I am very family oriented and love spending time with them.Having an older sister has taught me to be an active listener and follow the instructions. I have two younger brothers that have taught me to be patient and confident. Being a first generation student to graduate from college has allowed to me to cherish learning and strive to study.
    I also have a really great sense of humor, my favorite gif of all time is
